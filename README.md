## What I Learned
Doing this project I learned how to use the pyaduio library to be able to easily use Python to play and record audio to be able to record audio.
Then I used Speech Recognition then to take that audio and incorpating it with googles gTTS library to takes that audio and give the person a response back.
With a wakeword and a "who is" question I used the wikipedia library to find the persons wikipedia page and have the Virtual Assistant then read the first two sentence back to you.
